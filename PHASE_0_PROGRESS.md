## 🐛 Known Issues

1. Profile picture upload - placeholder only, needs implementation
2. Band member management buttons - UI only, no logic
3. Weather integration - not yet connected
4. Export functionality - not implemented
5. All pages still using mock data instead of database

---

## 💡 Technical Debt

1. Need to implement proper error boundaries
2. Loading states should be more consistent
3. Should add toast notifications for user feedback
4. Need to implement optimistic updates for better UX
5. Should add data caching strategy with React Query

- ✅ Build process works
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ PWA manifest ready
